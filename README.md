# Salesforce Agentforce Configuration

This repository contains configuration assets, metadata, and supporting resources for **Salesforce Agentforce** agents. It serves as a centralized reference for defining, deploying, and maintaining trusted agentic AI within the Salesforce ecosystem.

This repository provides configuration examples, reusable patterns, and trust-aligned practices to help implement and scale these agents safely and effectively.
